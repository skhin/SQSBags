About the Project:
For our 3rd project for our General Assembly's SEI Bootcamp, we were tasked to work in a group of 3 to come up with a MERN project.
Combining our love of online shopping, we decided to make an e-commerce store selling bags.
That was the birth of SQS BAGS (Sean Qizhen, Sireena Bags), your One-Stop Bagging Rights.

Division of Labour:

1. Sean handled the majority of the backend creation, manipulation and implementation.
2. Qizhen handled the user and registration data and creation that includes the front and back end.
3. Sireena handled the products data, creation and front-end aspects.
